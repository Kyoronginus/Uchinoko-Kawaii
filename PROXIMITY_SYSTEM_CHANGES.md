# Proximity-Based URL Interaction System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully transitioned from the zone-based `ProjectZoneManager` to a new proximity-based `ProximityInteractionManager` system. The new system provides cleaner, more intuitive distance-based interactions with URL-enabled objects.

## Changes Made

### 1. New ProximityInteractionManager (`src/interaction/ProximityInteractionManager.js`)
Created a new, focused proximity interaction manager with the following features:

#### Key Features:
- **Distance-based detection**: Continuously calculates distance to all interactive objects
- **Nearest object selection**: Automatically shows popup for the closest URL-enabled object within range
- **Smooth transitions**: Handles entering/exiting interaction range smoothly
- **Visual indicators**: Optional circular proximity visualizers around interactive objects
- **Configurable**: Customizable interaction distance, visualizer colors, and opacity
- **Event system**: Dispatches custom events (`proximityEnter`, `proximityExit`) for other systems

#### Configuration Options:
```javascript
{
    interactionDistance: 3.5,      // Distance threshold for triggering popup
    showVisualizers: true,          // Show/hide proximity circles
    visualizerColor: 0x00ffff,     // Cyan color for visualizers
    visualizerOpacity: 0.3         // Transparency of visualizers
}
```

#### Public API:
- `update(characterPosition)` - Call every frame to update proximity detection
- `getNearestObject()` - Get currently nearest interactive object
- `getCurrentDistance()` - Get distance to nearest object
- `isNearAnyObject()` - Check if character is near any interactive object
- `updateInteractiveObjects(newObjects)` - Update the list of interactive objects
- `setInteractionDistance(distance)` - Change interaction distance
- `setVisualizersVisible(show)` - Toggle visualizers on/off
- `dispose()` - Clean up resources

### 2. Updated script.js
- **Import**: Changed from `ProjectZoneManager` to `ProximityInteractionManager`
- **Variable**: Renamed `projectZoneManager` to `proximityManager`
- **Initialization**: Updated to use new constructor with configuration options
- **Update call**: Changed to use `proximityManager.update(charPos)`

### 3. Deprecated ProjectZoneManager
- Added deprecation warning to `ProjectZoneManager`
- File kept for backward compatibility but marked for future removal
- Console warning added to alert developers using the old system

## How It Works

### Detection Flow:
1. Every frame, `proximityManager.update(characterPosition)` is called
2. System calculates 2D distance (X-Z plane) from character to each interactive object
3. Finds the nearest object within `interactionDistance` (default: 3.5 units)
4. If nearest object changed:
   - Shows popup with object's name and URL
   - Dispatches `proximityEnter` event
5. If character moves out of range:
   - Hides popup
   - Dispatches `proximityExit` event

### Visual Indicators:
- Cyan circular rings at interaction distance around each object
- Semi-transparent filled circles for better visibility
- Can be toggled on/off or customized via configuration

## Interactive Objects
The system works with any object that has:
- A `mesh` (THREE.Mesh) for position tracking
- An `item` object with:
  - `url` property (string)
  - `name` property (string)

Currently configured for:
- Signposts (type: 'signpost')
- Statues (type: 'statue')

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality:
- [ ] Popup appears when character approaches URL-enabled object
- [ ] Popup shows correct name and URL for each object
- [ ] Popup disappears when character moves away
- [ ] Only nearest object's popup is shown when multiple objects are nearby

### Visual Indicators:
- [ ] Cyan circles visible around interactive objects
- [ ] Circles positioned correctly at object locations
- [ ] Circles have correct radius (3.5 units)

### Transitions:
- [ ] Smooth transition when moving between different objects
- [ ] No flickering or rapid popup changes
- [ ] Popup updates immediately when entering new object's range

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] Works correctly with multiple objects close together
- [ ] Handles objects at different heights (Y-axis ignored)
- [ ] No errors when no interactive objects are nearby
- [ ] System initializes correctly even if no objects have URLs

### Performance:
- [ ] No noticeable performance impact
- [ ] Console logs are reasonable (not spamming)
- [ ] Distance calculations are efficient

## Debug Information
The system includes built-in debug logging:
- Initialization info: Lists all interactive objects
- Periodic updates: Character position and object count (every 60 frames)
- Proximity alerts: When character is near objects (every 30 frames within 15 units)
- State changes: When entering/exiting interaction range

## Configuration Examples

### Increase interaction distance:
```javascript
proximityManager.setInteractionDistance(5.0)
```

### Hide visualizers:
```javascript
proximityManager.setVisualizersVisible(false)
```

### Custom colors:
```javascript
proximityManager = new ProximityInteractionManager(interactiveObjects, scene, {
    interactionDistance: 4.0,
    visualizerColor: 0xff00ff,  // Magenta
    visualizerOpacity: 0.5
})
```

## Migration Notes
If you have custom code using `ProjectZoneManager`:

### Old way:
```javascript
import { ProjectZoneManager } from './interaction/ProjectZoneManager.js'
let projectZoneManager = new ProjectZoneManager(projectEntries)
projectZoneManager.update(charPos)
```

### New way:
```javascript
import { ProximityInteractionManager } from './interaction/ProximityInteractionManager.js'
let proximityManager = new ProximityInteractionManager(interactiveObjects, scene, {
    interactionDistance: 3.5,
    showVisualizers: true
})
proximityManager.update(charPos)
```

## Benefits of New System

1. **Clearer naming**: "Proximity" better describes the distance-based behavior
2. **More configurable**: Easy to adjust distance, colors, and behavior
3. **Better organized**: Focused solely on proximity detection and popup management
4. **Event-driven**: Other systems can listen to proximity events
5. **Easier to extend**: Clean API for adding new features
6. **Better debugging**: Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements
Potential improvements for the system:
- Distance-based opacity (popup fades based on distance)
- Multiple interaction ranges (different actions at different distances)
- Directional detection (only show popup when facing object)
- Priority system (some objects take precedence over others)
- Animation effects (smooth fade in/out for visualizers)
- Sound effects on proximity enter/exit
