**Uchinoko Kawaii**

This project is an interactive website built to showcase the charm of my Original Character, Venna. It combines the retro aesthetic of 2D pixel art with modern 3D graphics and physics.

**Tech Stack & Skills**
This project showcases a wide range of skills in web development, 3D graphics, and digital art.

**Web & JavaScript**
HTML5 / CSS3: Structuring the application and styling the UI, including the loading screen and interactive elements.
JavaScript: Writing clean, modern, and modular code using Classes, ES Modules, and async/await for handling asynchronous asset loading. Additional technologies such as draco-compression extraction and the usage of .webp to shorten the page loading time are applied.
Vite: Utilizing a modern build tool for a fast and efficient development workflow and optimized production builds.

**3D Graphics & Rendering**
Three.js: The core of the project. Demonstrates a deep understanding of scene setup, lighting, shadows, materials, and managing complex 3D objects.
GLSL: Writing custom shaders for post-processing effects and unique material properties, such as the custom depth-of-field and pixelation shaders.
cannon-es: Implementing a 3D physics engine to create a dynamic and interactive world with realistic collisions and forces.

**Art & Asset Pipeline**
Blender: Modeling, UV unwrapping, draco compression, and exporting 3D assets (.glb) for the environment and interactive objects.
Pixel Art: Designing and creating animated 2D character sprites using Clip Studio Paint PRO.

**Deployment & Workflow**
Git & GitHub: Version control and management of the project's source code.
Netlify: Deploying the static site and utilizing the built-in CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments on every git push.
