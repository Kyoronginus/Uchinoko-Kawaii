**Tech Stack & Skills**
This project showcases a wide range of skills in web development, 3D graphics, and digital art.

**Web & JavaScript**
HTML5 / CSS3: Structuring the application and styling the UI, including the loading screen and interactive elements.
JavaScript: Writing clean, modern, and modular code using Classes, ES Modules, and async/await for handling asynchronous asset loading.
Vite: Utilizing a modern build tool for a fast and efficient development workflow and optimized production builds.

**3D Graphics & Rendering**
Three.js: The core of the project. Demonstrates a deep understanding of scene setup, lighting, shadows, materials, and managing complex 3D objects.
GLSL: Writing custom shaders for post-processing effects and unique material properties, such as the custom depth-of-field and pixelation shaders.
cannon-es: Implementing a 3D physics engine to create a dynamic and interactive world with realistic collisions and forces.

**Art & Asset Pipeline**
Blender: Modeling, UV unwrapping, and exporting 3D assets (.glb) for the environment and interactive objects.
Pixel Art: Designing and creating animated 2D character sprites using Clip Studio Paint PRO.

**Deployment & Workflow**
Git & GitHub: Version control and management of the project's source code.
Netlify: Deploying the static site and utilizing the built-in CI/CD pipeline for automatic deployments on every git push.
